---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Expandable Fare Family Selection (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Implement expandable flight cards with fare grid showing Fly, Fly+, FlyMax options

---

## Phase 6: User Story 4 - Dynamic Destination Backgrounds (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Implement destination-specific background images that fade in/out based on selection

**Checkpoint**: All user stories complete - full Velocity UI with RTL support

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - US1 and US2 are both P1 and can proceed in parallel
  - US3 depends on US2 (extends flight cards)
  - US4 can proceed independently after Foundational
  - US5 can proceed independently after Foundational
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on US1 + US2 minimum, ideally all stories

### User Story Dependencies

```
Foundational (Phase 2)
        │
        ├──► US1 (P1) Search Interface
        │         │
        │         └──► US2 (P1) Results Display ──► US3 (P2) Fare Selection
        │
        ├──► US4 (P2) Dynamic Backgrounds (independent)
        │
        └──► US5 (P3) RTL Support (independent)
```

### Within Each User Story

- Models/state before components
- Components before screen integration
- Screen integration before wiring to ScreenModel

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 1 (all parallel)**:
- T001, T002, T003 - all font/image downloads

**Phase 2 (partial parallel)**:
- T007, T008 - glassmorphism components
- T009, T010, T011, T012, T013, T014 - all state/model definitions
- T015, T016 - string resources

**Phase 3 - US1 (partial parallel)**:
- T017, T018, T019, T020, T021, T022 - all independent components

**Phase 4 - US2 (partial parallel)**:
- T028, T029, T030 - all independent components

**Phase 5 - US3**:
- T037, T038 - fare components (parallel)

**Phase 6 - US4**:
- T043, T044 - background component (same file, sequential)

**Phase 7 - US5 (partial parallel)**:
- T048, T049 - typography and toggle (parallel)

**Phase 8 (all parallel)**:
- T055, T056, T057 - all state composables

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1 + 2)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (fonts, images)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (theme, state models)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (search interface)
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (results display)
5. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test end-to-end search flow
6. Deploy/demo if ready - core Velocity experience complete

### Incremental Delivery

1. Setup + Foundational → Design system ready
2. Add US1 (Search) → Test search interface → Demo
3. Add US2 (Results) → Test full flow → Demo (MVP!)
4. Add US3 (Fares) → Test expansion → Demo
5. Add US4 (Backgrounds) → Test transitions → Demo
6. Add US5 (RTL) → Test Arabic → Demo
7. Polish phase → Final release

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Search)
   - Developer B: User Story 4 (Backgrounds)
   - Developer C: User Story 5 (RTL)
3. After US1 complete:
   - Developer A: User Story 2 (Results)
4. After US2 complete:
   - Developer A: User Story 3 (Fares)
5. Stories integrate incrementally

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Refer to quickstart.md for testing checklist
- Refer to research.md for implementation patterns
- Refer to data-model.md for state structure
